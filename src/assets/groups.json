        "abstract": "The thesis study was formulated by the proponents to help locate professionals that are near a specific individual and communicate with them. Correspondingly, it will also help various professionals to establish connections and trust with the clients who connect with them. Using the Google API, and the Android operating system while applying the Kanban scheduling system upon building the software, the proponents developed a mobile application that will locate professionals on the map and can be filtered based on their category (8 professions) or their distance-by-radius (the user is the center of the circle). It also lets the clients view the profile of the professionals which contains relevant details such as their ratings about them, experiences, skills, and others. Further, once a client connects with professionals, then he or she will be able to chat with them. There is also an event feature that will let professionals create events that can be configured to allow clients or only their fellow professionals to participate in them. Moreover, the proponents surveyed 30 respondents, consisting of 15 clients and 15 professionals. The respondents rated the application with a weighted mean of 4.78 in terms of Functionality which is equivalent to 'Excellent' and it can be inferred that it is useful for both clients and professionals. Future researchers can enrich the proponents' study by using other shortest-path algorithms which have a faster time complexity than O(V^3), wherein V is the total number of vertices. Also, utilize SQL databases (i.e., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) with a proper design in order to query swiftly.",

Face recognition has been used in earlier studies using a variety of methods and algorithms and through this, the application combined 5 algorithms for facial and emotion detection; the detected and analyzed captured input was processed with the use of Viola-Jones algorithm and Haar-like features. The emotions represented will then be determined by feature extraction using HOG and LBP. Lastly, the detected face will be categorized using SVM into categories that specify the emotions it expresses. Liwanag caters 18 emotions that are composed of 7 basic emotions and 11 compound emotions. The application was tested by 50 respondents that are composed of visually impaired, IT/CS professionals, and psychology professionals to evaluate the overall functionality of the application. The overall accuracy of the application attained 56%, still, the overall rating of the application based on the respondents is 5.83 out of 7. This rating reflects as Agree. The proponents advised future researchers to use different classification algorithm aside from SVM, adding features such as basing the predicted expression based on the tone of the voice, being able to recognize the person they are talking to, giving the user an option to choose the time of interval between predictions, and lastly, to fully integrate all the components into one by using compatible frameworks to make the application independent.",

        "abstract": "Grocery shopping can often be viewed as a chore by most people, specifically men, especially if an individual does not know where a specific item that they need is located. An average shopping trip lasts for 41 minutes, and an average shopper spends more than 53 hours a year in a grocery store. Existing solutions for this problem may include online shopping, wherein a user may check-out from a particular store using a website or an application, and have it delivered directly at his or her home. However, this also does not solve the problem for people who prefer to shop on-site for a more personalized experience, as well as the staff of grocery services, since even though the buyer was able to place a grocery order online, the assigned grocery store would still need to gather the respective items. The researchers then decided to create a system that aims to reduce the total time spent and distance traveled, by generating a route inside the store that gathers all the user‚Äôs needed items. The said system made use of a heuristic that is based algorithms used for graph traversal and pathfinding algorithms, such as the A* Algorithm and 2-Opt Algorithm, as well as an implementation of the Apriori Algorithm for frequently bought products recommendation. A comparison was made between a shopper with the application and a shopper without the application, using a randomized list of ten items. The researchers found that it is indeed faster to gather a certain list of items using the application, and there is a very significant difference when it comes to the total distance traveled inside the store.

The proponents propose using a single-camera pseudo-distance based algorithm as a trigger for facial recognition to record personnel presence within an organization's premises. Also, considering current times, the facial recognition model is trained to recognize users, regardless of whether they are masked or otherwise. This system shall be another alternative to manual methods while also aiming to eliminate any need for skin contact to any additional surfaces to curb the spread of harmful material like viruses, which are known to infect people without manifested symptoms [7]. And being that COVID-19 can be potentially fatal [3], it has become even more important for systems to be in place to prevent further spread of such viruses. The system makes use of the YOLOv5 model for object detection and the VGG-19 model for classification. A line detection algorithm is created to facilitate the recognition of personnel within the imagespace. (1) Video frames are input into the system for (2) the YOLOv5 model to detect faces and regions-of-interest (ROIs) within the image. A line threshold is manually set on the imagespace, usually close to the bottom of the image, as a means to trigger ROI detection, when a detected face reaches the said threshold. (3) The line detection algorithm is used to check the faces' location within the image. When a face is detected to be within range via the threshold, (4) ROI detection is run on the region where the face is, then (5) the VGG-19 model takes the input ROI and draws an inference on the person's identity. (6) An inference filtering algorithm is also created to sift through the inferences made by the classifier to arrive at a final conclusion. The models generated very favorable results during the testing phase, with the object detection getting 90.2% overall, while the system got 93.31%, 80.43%, and 92.5% for the recognition accuracy results for the per-frame, per-run, and per-run without false negatives tests, respectively. An overall system score of 4.68/5.00 was recorded as scored by 38 respondents, a mix of CS/IT Students, CS/IT Professionals, non-CS/IT Employees and non-CS/IT Managers. ",

This project aims to analyze the music-related data inside a MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) recording to understand the behavior of each piano performance. The extracted data includes three major components: note accuracy, note-timing, and melody similarity. These three data will then be compared to the ground truth data using an approximate pattern-matching algorithm to determine the similarity of user performance compared to the original music score. The researchers provided the assessment report by scaling them from general to specific results. The researchers implemented a constraint-based learning model that allows users to learn through mistakes with a set of constraints. The project was evaluated by 30 respondents, composed of beginner piano players, experienced piano players, music professionals, and software engineers. Software evaluation was conducted with on-site testing inside Far Eastern University Manila for beginner and experienced piano players. Research result suggests that both piano player categories have improved and progressed with the proposed project's aid. Research data shows that users tend to easily adapt to hitting the correct notes along the music sequence but struggle on achieving proper timing such as articulation and rhythm. Overall this research shows that pattern-matching algorithms can be used on assessing piano performance with the assistance of MIDI technology. ",

        "abstract": "Sheet music is objective and straightforward, yet intricate in its structure and nuances. It represents the ideal medium for conferring the subtle properties of music such as rhythm, tempo, pitch, sequencing, and sizeable variations of accidentals. Different image recognition software for sheet music exists today; the field coined Optical Music Recognition (OMR). This enables immediate understanding of a piece's musical composition. To improve upon this, the proponents aimed to implement editing functionality towards a scanned sheet music score after processing the initial sheet music image through ABC notation. Recognition of individual musical components such as notes, pitch, and rhythm will further support the user's learning experience with music and assess the modulation of personal music theory ideas. Further cementing the understanding of sheet music, the user will also be presented with the option of finding similar sounding scores through a local database of previously scanned sheet music. The first option compares the track's base statistics such as composer, genre, tempo, etc. For the second option, The proponents utilized Parson's code; A phonetic system of identifying melodic patterns by identifying the tendency of the pitch to go up or down. String matching algorithms compared each track's Parson's code to evaluate its melodic similarity among one another. The system was able to achieve an accuracy of 92.56% in detection of note heads across nine image samples of three test cases each. Inconsistencies in note recognition often occurred in clumped note heads across a tight vertical plane along a staff line. Software assessment across performance, reliability, portability, functionality, and usability achieved an overall score of 4.82 among 50 respondents. Moving forward, improvement in the OMR algorithms will enable further accuracy in complex, contemporary style sheet music. Along with this, general frontend improvements will greatly hone the software, such as realtime editing of musical components during playback will further improve upon the user's experience for efficiency.

        "abstract": "Similarities between the potential adopter and pets are critical and contribute to a high likelihood of adoption success. Several factors must be evaluated prior to committing to adopting a pet, including one's lifestyle and personality. Pet owners encounter difficulties when acquiring a pet such as experiencing problems with the pet's behavior, finding that their pet is incompatible with other pets and themselves, having preconceived expectations that failed to be met after adopting, and developing issues with their health and household. All of these lead to unsuccessful pet adopts and eventual pet returns [1]. To help address this issue, the proponents came up with an application that will aid in decreasing the cases of pet abandonment and pet returns to animal shelters. The application will determine the compatibility between potential pet adopters and pets via questionnaires. It will then use recommendation algorithms and the multi-criteria decisionmaking approach to recommend pets to potential adopters. The proponents surveyed 22 respondents. 16 of whom were potential pet adopters, 4 were CS/IT professionals, and 2 were animal shelters. Adapting ISO 25010 - specifically functionality, reliability, usability, and efficiency - a total average of 4.37 were gathered from potential pet adopters, 4.33 from CS/IT Professionals, and 4.50 from Non-profit animal shelters. These values affirm that the application has indeed piqued its target market's interest in the application.

        "abstract": "This study aims to help Yoga practitioners who are either keen on learning how to properly perform the various postures involved in Yoga, or to those who want to practice Yoga at home without paying for classes and having to travel a lot by providing them with a way to verify whether their posture is correct with a single snapshot. The proponent‚Äôs goal is to make Yoga a more accessible practice to the general public by offering them a handheld Yoga Guru whose main purpose is to ensure that they are correctly performing the various poses that are involved in the practice without the need for enrolling in an expensive Yoga class or by hiring a Yoga guru. With this in mind, Yoga as practice is advertised as an activity which is accessible to everyone due to its low demands in external tools and physical requirements. According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission in 2019, there were more than 34,000 Yoga related injuries sustained during that year alone. The implementation of this application would eliminate the fear of practicing Yoga wrongfully which could lead to long-standing chronic problems which is commonly caused by repetitive strain to and overstretching of the neck, shoulders, spine, legs, and knees. With the aid of a Yoga Guru with more than 10 years of experience the proponents were able to produce an application consisting of 11 Yoga Asanas or postures divided into three Yoga flows that is able to track and assess its users whilst practicing Yoga. This was done with the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, and CNN G-HUM BlazePose 3D Models. ",

The goal of this study was to develop an Android app that could scan medicine packaging using image processing to recognize fraudulent medications. A descriptive study was employed by the researchers to give systematic information about a phenomenon. The study employed Sloven's Formula to determine the population size of responders (15) in the field of Computer Science or Information Technology, as well as Pharmacists, in terms of how well the application performs and is successful. On a 5-point Likert scale, the sample's view of the application was evaluated. The reliability of the survey questions can be evaluated using the Cronbach's Alpha. Each of the five data sets (Alaxan, Biogesic, Neozep, Kremil-s, and Bioflu) had 100 pieces of counterfeit medication obtained from the internet, primarily from the FDA website, along with 60 authentic medication pieces that the researchers had physically gathered. The program detects genuine Biogesic packaging with 80% accuracy and fraudulent Biogesic packaging with 100% accuracy. Real Alaxan packaging is 80% accurate, whereas fake Alaxan packaging is 96% accurate. There is an 80% accuracy for genuine Kremil-S and a 92% accuracy for phony medicine packing. Bioflu is 88% accurate, whereas fraudulent Bioflu is 92% accurate. and for Neozep, 92% for genuine and 100% for counterfeit.

Using one's smartphone for preparedness is the most viable option as smartphones are always attached to their owners. A beacon could also be used as crime prevention. It is a source of light or fire that acts as a signal or warning. Beacons aid in situational awareness. Similarly, an application that can act as a beacon can aid in determining an individual's safety. The researchers propose to develop an application that helps in those sketchy situations. The application would be like a beacon that sends out alert signals to authorities or loved ones. It utilizes A* Algorithm to track the route between the victim and alert recipient. The app also includes a chat function with Two-fish encryption to give ongoing messages of the current situation with additional image attachment support. Lastly, it logs the reports for the authority. Hence, authorities can keep track of the number of incidents and archive the cases faster with the builtin automatic timestamps and basic user info. For the location tracking to be precise and encryption accurate. The researchers prepared multiple test cases for both with comparing their given data to other similar methods like Bing Maps and CRC32 respectively.

Using the YOLOv5 Object Detection algorithm, the Time Series models for prediction of the number of people in a room, as well as a web interface for universal access of information, the proponents of this study prepared a proof-of- concept that demonstrates how effective the system is, even with just a use of a web camera. In tests, the YOLOv5 scored a 61% to 78% accuracy, and it performs enough to determine an area's occupancy, with a correlation of 0.56 for head detection, meaning that it is moderately correlated, and 0.31 for body detection, which means that it is fairly correlated. Prediction models are also able to loosely predict peak area occupancy with tests setting its peak detection in the afternoon. In addition, an evaluation based on the ISO 25010 standard is performed to 30 respondents, in which all eight categories scored a \"strongly agree\" on each. Despite delays, the developed system performs well in identifying and predicting occupancy of an area through object detection and classification in record time. In addition, a month-long testing of the system is performed to allow the evaluation of the said system, and based on the study's results, majority of the respondents agree that the use of this system can aid in resolving the problems of people with regards to building occupancy.

The proponents of this study aimed to address this volatility problem by developing an LSTM predictive model that generates an accurate forecast that is fed with sequential and/or temporal dataset and validated using RMSE as its scoring rule, the predictive model's forecast will be deployed into an interactive website for the AXS investors or future investors to analyze. The website's quality, reliability, and overall design was evaluated using ISO 9126 Criteria from the questionnaire that were constructed by the proponents. The same questionnaire is also used for capturing the attitude of the AXS Investors in terms of Liquidating, Holding, Selling and Buying. The predictive model yielded an Accurate Normalized RMSE value of 0.2495 wherein its forecast captured the downward trend from October to November 2022, at the time where this study is being conducted, also half of the sample from the study who are prioritizing on Minimizing Loss are hesitant to Trade/Play where the other half are confident enough from the generated forecast from the website. The study shows that the predictive model's forecast which is deployed in the website guided half of the sample, they are those who are prioritizing on Maximizing Profit which is AXS Investors and also those who didn't change their plan.",

        "title": "iCHOR: Classification of Different Red Blood Cell Abnormalites using Deep Learning",
        "abstract": "The Philippines is plagued by its lack of healthcare workers and access to basic healthcare. Hence, some Filipinos are struggling to help themselves when it comes to diseases. The hematology sector is no different because although there are ways to detect abnormalities in the blood, such as the peripheral blood smear test and digital morphological analyzers, both give off disadvantages that can affect the speed and accuracy of the results. In addition to the medical issues stated above, the field has not embraced digitization yet, which is a loss, as technology can be of great help in advancing our healthcare even more. The development of the system offers a solution to aid medical workers in detecting diseases within the blood, a cheaper blood test option for patients, and the introduction of another technological breakthrough to the community. To detect white blood cells, and 13 types of abnormalities in the red blood cells, the convolutional neural network algorithm is implemented, specifically, the YOLOv4 model of the You Only Look Once series, in training the machine using a validated open-sourced dataset. 45 respondents comprising Information Technology of Computer Science professionals, medical technology graduates, pathologists, and resident pathologists volunteered to evaluate the desktop application. The respondents rated the application an average of 0.99 out of 1.0 across the categories according to ISO 9126-1 and reflects to be satisfactory. For future studies, there are recommendations to further the training process of the machine, better the user interface of the program, ability to import multiple images, and add color-based abnormalities.",
        "description": "iCHOR is a desktop application that detects and classifies 11 types of red blood cell abnormalities in a human's peripheral blood smear, in which each carries a different disease. Furthermore, it can save the red blood cell count per type, and the possible related diseases in a database. It aims to aid medical practitioners in their patients' diagnosis - a faster, cheaper, and more efficient way than the traditional method of manually checking each type of cell. This application is made through Python with a Convolutional Neural Network algorithm, specifically, the You Only Look Once 4 model- a common algorithm used in the medical field. With an 80% confidence threshold, iCHOR ensures that it is the gateway to efficient hematology.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we aim to classify selected invasive plants in the Philippines using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers in order to reduce the ecological and economic impact of these species. Invasive plants can cause significant harm to native ecosystems, and effective identification and management of these species are crucial for mitigating their negative effects. By training CNNs and KNN classifiers on images of the selected invasive plants, we aim to develop a reliable and efficient method for accurately identifying these species in the wild. Also, this research presents a novel approach for gathering data on plant species, which could be utilized by policy-making organizations such as the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) or other forestry institutions. The results of this study can inform the development of more effective strategies for managing invasive plants in the Philippines, which can help reduce the negative impacts of these species on the environment and economy.
