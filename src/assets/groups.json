        "abstract": "The thesis study was formulated by the proponents to help locate professionals that are near a specific individual and communicate with them. Correspondingly, it will also help various professionals to establish connections and trust with the clients who connect with them. Using the Google API, and the Android operating system while applying the Kanban scheduling system upon building the software, the proponents developed a mobile application that will locate professionals on the map and can be filtered based on their category (8 professions) or their distance-by-radius (the user is the center of the circle). It also lets the clients view the profile of the professionals which contains relevant details such as their ratings about them, experiences, skills, and others. Further, once a client connects with professionals, then he or she will be able to chat with them. There is also an event feature that will let professionals create events that can be configured to allow clients or only their fellow professionals to participate in them. Moreover, the proponents surveyed 30 respondents, consisting of 15 clients and 15 professionals. The respondents rated the application with a weighted mean of 4.78 in terms of Functionality which is equivalent to 'Excellent' and it can be inferred that it is useful for both clients and professionals. Future researchers can enrich the proponents' study by using other shortest-path algorithms which have a faster time complexity than O(V^3), wherein V is the total number of vertices. Also, utilize SQL databases (i.e., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) with a proper design in order to query swiftly.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this study was to develop an Android mobile application entitled 'Liwanag' that enables visually impaired individuals to use facial recognition to determine the emotion of the person they are interacting with. Face recognition has been used in earlier studies using a variety of methods and algorithms and through this, the application combined 5 algorithms for facial and emotion detection; the detected and analyzed captured input was processed with the use of Viola-Jones algorithm and Haar-like features. The emotions represented will then be determined by feature extraction using HOG and LBP. Lastly, the detected face will be categorized using SVM into categories that specify the emotions it expresses. Liwanag caters 18 emotions that are composed of 7 basic emotions and 11 compound emotions. The application was tested by 50 respondents that are composed of visually impaired, IT/CS professionals, and psychology professionals to evaluate the overall functionality of the application. The overall accuracy of the application attained 56%, still, the overall rating of the application based on the respondents is 5.83 out of 7. This rating reflects as Agree. The proponents advised future researchers to use different classification algorithm aside from SVM, adding features such as basing the predicted expression based on the tone of the voice, being able to recognize the person they are talking to, giving the user an option to choose the time of interval between predictions, and lastly, to fully integrate all the components into one by using compatible frameworks to make the application independent.",

        "abstract": "Grocery shopping can often be viewed as a chore by most people, specifically men, especially if an individual does not know where a specific item that they need is located. An average shopping trip lasts for 41 minutes, and an average shopper spends more than 53 hours a year in a grocery store. Existing solutions for this problem may include online shopping, wherein a user may check-out from a particular store using a website or an application, and have it delivered directly at his or her home. However, this also does not solve the problem for people who prefer to shop on-site for a more personalized experience, as well as the staff of grocery services, since even though the buyer was able to place a grocery order online, the assigned grocery store would still need to gather the respective items. The researchers then decided to create a system that aims to reduce the total time spent and distance traveled, by generating a route inside the store that gathers all the user‚Äôs needed items. The said system made use of a heuristic that is based algorithms used for graph traversal and pathfinding algorithms, such as the A* Algorithm and 2-Opt Algorithm, as well as an implementation of the Apriori Algorithm for frequently bought products recommendation. A comparison was made between a shopper with the application and a shopper without the application, using a randomized list of ten items. The researchers found that it is indeed faster to gather a certain list of items using the application, and there is a very significant difference when it comes to the total distance traveled inside the store. The application was then evaluated based on the standards of the ISO-9126, and garnered an average rating of 4.66, with the Usability and Effectiveness category gathering the highest scores, and the Maintainability category gathering the lowest scores.",

        "abstract": "Sheet music is objective and straightforward, yet intricate in its structure and nuances. It represents the ideal medium for conferring the subtle properties of music such as rhythm, tempo, pitch, sequencing, and sizeable variations of accidentals. Different image recognition software for sheet music exists today; the field coined Optical Music Recognition (OMR). This enables immediate understanding of a piece's musical composition. To improve upon this, the proponents aimed to implement editing functionality towards a scanned sheet music score after processing the initial sheet music image through ABC notation. Recognition of individual musical components such as notes, pitch, and rhythm will further support the user's learning experience with music and assess the modulation of personal music theory ideas. Further cementing the understanding of sheet music, the user will also be presented with the option of finding similar sounding scores through a local database of previously scanned sheet music. The first option compares the track's base statistics such as composer, genre, tempo, etc. For the second option, The proponents utilized Parson's code; A phonetic system of identifying melodic patterns by identifying the tendency of the pitch to go up or down. String matching algorithms compared each track's Parson's code to evaluate its melodic similarity among one another. The system was able to achieve an accuracy of 92.56% in detection of note heads across nine image samples of three test cases each. Inconsistencies in note recognition often occurred in clumped note heads across a tight vertical plane along a staff line. Software assessment across performance, reliability, portability, functionality, and usability achieved an overall score of 4.82 among 50 respondents. Moving forward, improvement in the OMR algorithms will enable further accuracy in complex, contemporary style sheet music. Along with this, general frontend improvements will greatly hone the software, such as realtime editing of musical components during playback will further improve upon the user's experience for efficiency. ",
        "description": "SMR is an application wherein proponents can convert an image into digital audio while maximizing the potential of the edit function. Once the image is converted through image processing and machine learning, the users can use the application to hear the musical output of the sheet, and view recommended similar music through comparing the metadata or melody to other songs inside the application‚Äôs database. In the end, it can be exported to a playable audio format and/or a digital image.",

        "title": "Pet Lifestyle Matcher and Adoption Application Using Recommendation Algorithms",
        "abstract": "Similarities between the potential adopter and pets are critical and contribute to a high likelihood of adoption success. Several factors must be evaluated prior to committing to adopting a pet, including one's lifestyle and personality. Pet owners encounter difficulties when acquiring a pet such as experiencing problems with the pet's behavior, finding that their pet is incompatible with other pets and themselves, having preconceived expectations that failed to be met after adopting, and developing issues with their health and household. All of these lead to unsuccessful pet adopts and eventual pet returns [1]. To help address this issue, the proponents came up with an application that will aid in decreasing the cases of pet abandonment and pet returns to animal shelters. The application will determine the compatibility between potential pet adopters and pets via questionnaires. It will then use recommendation algorithms and the multi-criteria decisionmaking approach to recommend pets to potential adopters. The proponents surveyed 22 respondents. 16 of whom were potential pet adopters, 4 were CS/IT professionals, and 2 were animal shelters. Adapting ISO 25010 - specifically functionality, reliability, usability, and efficiency - a total average of 4.37 were gathered from potential pet adopters, 4.33 from CS/IT Professionals, and 4.50 from Non-profit animal shelters. These values affirm that the application has indeed piqued its target market's interest in the application. For future studies, the proponents recommend for the application to have an iOS version, an in-app messaging option, a flowchart on how the application works, a feedback feature for successful adoptions, a feature where shelters can post pets' updates, and a filter function for the animal list.",

The proponent‚Äôs goal is to make Yoga a more accessible practice to the general public by offering them a handheld Yoga Guru whose main purpose is to ensure that they are correctly performing the various poses that are involved in the practice without the need for enrolling in an expensive Yoga class or by hiring a Yoga guru. With this in mind, Yoga as practice is advertised as an activity which is accessible to everyone due to its low demands in external tools and physical requirements. According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission in 2019, there were more than 34,000 Yoga related injuries sustained during that year alone. The implementation of this application would eliminate the fear of practicing Yoga wrongfully which could lead to long-standing chronic problems which is commonly caused by repetitive strain to and overstretching of the neck, shoulders, spine, legs, and knees. With the aid of a Yoga Guru with more than 10 years of experience the proponents were able to produce an application consisting of 11 Yoga Asanas or postures divided into three Yoga flows that is able to track and assess its users whilst practicing Yoga. This was done with the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, and CNN G-HUM BlazePose 3D Models. ",

Using the YOLOv5 Object Detection algorithm, the Time Series models for prediction of the number of people in a room, as well as a web interface for universal access of information, the proponents of this study prepared a proof-of- concept that demonstrates how effective the system is, even with just a use of a web camera. In tests, the YOLOv5 scored a 61% to 78% accuracy, and it performs enough to determine an area's occupancy, with a correlation of 0.56 for head detection, meaning that it is moderately correlated, and 0.31 for body detection, which means that it is fairly correlated. Prediction models are also able to loosely predict peak area occupancy with tests setting its peak detection in the afternoon. In addition, an evaluation based on the ISO 25010 standard is performed to 30 respondents, in which all eight categories scored a \"strongly agree\" on each. Despite delays, the developed system performs well in identifying and predicting occupancy of an area through object detection and classification in record time. In addition, a month-long testing of the system is performed to allow the evaluation of the said system, and based on the study's results, majority of the respondents agree that the use of this system can aid in resolving the problems of people with regards to building occupancy.

This study developed a system based on Twitter as this micro-blogging site has not officially developed any Recommender System for their platform. The proponents of this study applied multiple algorithms to create unique functions, namely: Influence Scoring Formula by Abdessamad Essaidi et. al for Influence Ranking, Breadth-First Search and Longest Path for Reach and Engagements, Louvain Algorithm and Betweenness Centrality for Gatekeeper Identification. The system has been evaluated by 40 respondents. It was composed of 20 entrepreneurs/business owners, 10 CS/IT professionals and 10 Twitter users. The result of the evaluation, 4.11 [entrepreneurs/business owners], 4.50 [CS/IT professionals], 3.78 [Twitter users], showed that all of the respondents can be considered Satisfied with the system. However, the results also pointed out that efficiency requires to be improved and written feedback from respondents wanted major changes on user interface. Finally, full archive or highest level access to Twitter user's dataset is the greatest recommendation for shorter time in processing output and to drastically improve efficiency. For future researchers, models based on other social platforms are recommended.",

The hematology sector is no different because although there are ways to detect abnormalities in the blood, such as the peripheral blood smear test and digital morphological analyzers, both give off disadvantages that can affect the speed and accuracy of the results. In addition to the medical issues stated above, the field has not embraced digitization yet, which is a loss, as technology can be of great help in advancing our healthcare even more. The development of the system offers a solution to aid medical workers in detecting diseases within the blood, a cheaper blood test option for patients, and the introduction of another technological breakthrough to the community. To detect white blood cells, and 13 types of abnormalities in the red blood cells, the convolutional neural network algorithm is implemented, specifically, the YOLOv4 model of the You Only Look Once series, in training the machine using a validated open-sourced dataset. 45 respondents comprising Information Technology of Computer Science professionals, medical technology graduates, pathologists, and resident pathologists volunteered to evaluate the desktop application. The respondents rated the application an average of 0.99 out of 1.0 across the categories according to ISO 9126-1 and reflects to be satisfactory. For future studies, there are recommendations to further the training process of the machine, better the user interface of the program, ability to import multiple images, and add color-based abnormalities.",
